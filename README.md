# RedSquare
A very simple game I made to get used to SDL and test out [YASL](https://github.com/yasl-lang/yasl).

## Dependencies
- SDL
- SDL TTF
- SDL Image
- YASL

## How To Play
Compile and run it. Use arrow keys to move the red square. 
The goal is to reach the green square without touching anything black.
Pres spacebar to reset everything after either dying or reaching the green square.

## Editing The Level
You can edit the level by changing the YASL file `level.yasl`. There's no need to recompile;
The new level will be loaded next time you reset things with spacebar.
